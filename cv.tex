%% Profile
\cvsection{Profile}
Software engineer currently working in data infrastructure and customer data privacy at Spotify. I develop tools and infrastructure for ensuring customer data privacy in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation for both batch and realtime applications. I have also worked on high-volume event delivery as well as scheduling and orchestration. Previously, I worked both professionally and in a research capacity in functional programming using Erlang and Haskell. Broadly speaking, I am interested in building my career as an engineer and am especially but not exclusively interested in applications of functional programming.

\cvsection{Experience}
\jobheader{Lead Engineer, Data Infrastructure}{2015—Present}{Spotify AB}{Stockholm, Sweden}
\smallskip
Spotify is a leading online music-streaming service with 180 million active users in 65 markets 
worldwide with mobile and desktop applications. All roles included operational responsibilities and on-call duty rotations.
\smallskip
{\it Data Privacy Infrastructure} (current team)
\parindent=20pt
\item{$\diamond$} Defined Spotify's strategy for dealing with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, using per-user, centrally managed encryption keys to encrypt all personal data.
\item{$\diamond$} Formed and lead the team that built a key management system that provides realtime key derivation and issuing in Java, using Cassandra to provide global replication to three different sites on three different continents.
\item{$\diamond$} Wrote clients and encryption/decryption libraries for use in realtime microservices as well as batch processing on Cloud Dataflow, using either Java (Apache Beam) or Scala (Scio, an open-source implementation of Beam written and maintained at Spotify).
\item{$\diamond$} Automate the encryption and decryption of data on analysis platforms to hide such complexity from internal customers.
\item{$\diamond$} Continuously work to optimise these solutions to decrease overhead and reduce the associated costs incurred from cloud resource usage.
\item{$\diamond$} Evaluate technologies from Google to replace non-cloud products currently in use.
\parindent=0pt

{\it Event Delivery}
\parindent=20pt
\item{$\diamond$} Migrated from a cross-site, Kafka-based event delivery system to a Google Cloud-based system using Cloud PubSub that processes over 2 million messages per second and is responsible for collection, deduplication, and batching of events.
\item{$\diamond$} Automated the setup and teardown of all infrastructure associated with delivering a given event type, allowing other developers and analysts at Spotify to declare new event types in YAML files and automatically create all necessary infrastructure within 1 hour. 
\item{$\diamond$} Regularly monitored and improved scalability metrics as demand grew with respect to number of event types and total event volume.
\parindent=0pt

{\it Scheduling and Orchestration}
\parindent=20pt
\item{$\diamond$} Developed and maintained Luigi, an open-source job orchestration framework in Python.
\item{$\diamond$} Participated in the initial stages of the data infrastructure migration to Google Cloud Platform, including meetings with teams at Google to set requirements and strategy.
\item{$\diamond$} Helped build the next-generation scheduling platform at Spotify in Java using Kubernetes to run user-defined Docker images and data jobs executed on Hadoop and Cloud Dataflow.
\item{$\diamond$} Lead the project to make data infrastructure and royalty reporting compliant with IT General Controls as part of Spotify's Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.

\parindent=0pt

{\it Risk Team}
\parindent=20pt
\item{$\diamond$} Developed and maintained realtime risk assessment
systems used by risk analysts to make credit and fraud decisions for online shoppers in Erlang and Java.
\item{$\diamond$} Migrated from a risk decision engine inside an Erlang monolith to
a Java-based third-party product in a zero-downtime, phased migration.
\item{$\diamond$} Automated deployment tasks required for regulatory compliance, 
allowing risk analysts to deploy automatically several times daily instead of once 
weekly.
\parindent=0pt

{\it Finance Team}
\parindent=20pt
\item{$\diamond$} Wrote integrations with financial institutions in various markets to support local
payment methods in Erlang.
\item{$\diamond$} Refactored large parts of the legacy payment batch processing system to allow for parallel
